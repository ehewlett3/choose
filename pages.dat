You are standing in a field in front of a white house. There is a mailbox here.
You are on the front porch of a white house. There is a locked door in front of you.
You find yourself in a scraggly forest. All is dark, as the sunlight struggles to get through the thick foliage. To the north there is a glimmer of light...
The locked door does not yield to your futile attempts to open it.
